<p>My family and I visited The Statue of Unity this summer.</p>

	<aside>
		<h4>The Statue of Unity</h4>
		<p>The Statue of Unity is a colossal statue of Indian statesman and independence activist Vallabhbhai Patel (1875â€“1950),
			who was the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home minister of independent India and adherent of Mahatma Gandhi during the
			non-violent Indian Independence movement.</p>
	</aside>

<p>The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue at 182 metres (597 ft). It rises 54 metres (177 ft) higher than the
		previous record holder, the Spring Temple Buddha in China's Henan province. The previous tallest statue in India was the
		41 m (135 ft) tall statue of Lord Hanuman at the Paritala Anjaneya Temple near Vijayawada in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
